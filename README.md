# kalman-filter-algorithm
#### Goal: Kalman Filter Algorithm for apogee detection
Project members: Abitamim Bharmal (@Abitamim)
#### What should this look like?

**inputs**: barometer data (double), as well as the read voltage from the sensor (w/ an option to include data from the IMU; however this could get sketchy quick)

**outputs**: Current elevation of rocket (double) & Apogee detected (boolean) 

###  Workflow?

* Primarily using kalmanfilter.net/ as our go to resource for building the initial stages of the filter, as well as research.
* Supplementing with other sources allong the way as we see fit (keep record of what/why we used what we did)
* May have professional help with the final stage of our filter -- but we should be at the point of an mvp before that point.

### Timeline:

TBD
